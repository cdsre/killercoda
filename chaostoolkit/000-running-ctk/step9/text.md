# Report on your Findings

## Review the Journal of the Run

You may now review the journal generated by the run: `cat ~/ctk-simple/journal.json`, it contains the activities runs 
and the output of each of them.

## Install The Reporting Plugin

You can generate a PDF (or HTML, markdownâ€¦) report from the journal if you install the 
[chaostoolkit-reporting](https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-reporting) plugin and its dependencies first:

```bash
apt install -y pandoc libcairo2-dev
pip install chaostoolkit-reporting
```{{copy}}

We can now produce more human friendly html or PDF reports. Create an html report

```bash
chaos report --export-format=html5 journal.json report.html
```{{copy}}
